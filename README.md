# Boxer
It's moving day!
## Purpose

To create a simple web app for keeping track of the contents of moving boxes with QR codes.

## Tech
For this project I'm using the following tech stack:
- React
- Bootstrap for React
- CSS
- Node qrcode (QR-code generation)

## How to use
1. Start by creating a new box, give it a name.
2. Input what you have inside the box.
3. The program will now generate a QR-code and a URL for you to use.

If you are using this with, for instance, a sticker printer then you can use the URL to create a QR-code separately.
